# MLProject
Code + generated data for ML project in CSCI 5622

The raw and cleaned data products are too large to host in their entirety, but following discussion in class on 9/20 I have added samples of raw and cleaned datasets. 

The raw combined SDSS samples can be found [here](SDSS/rawCombinedSample.csv), the cleaned SDSS data (without sizes) [here](SDSS/combined_noSize_cleanedSample.csv), and the cleaned SDSS data with sizes [here](SDSS/combined_wSize_cleanedSample.csv).

The raw generated model data can be found [here](MCMC/tagged_samples.csv) and the cleaned data [here](MCMC/data/combined_taggedSamples_cleaned_reduced.csv).
